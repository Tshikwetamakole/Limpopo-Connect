## Current Status ✅
- ✅ **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automated deployment on every push to main branch

- ✅ **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App with service worker and manifest
- ✅ **Build Optimization**: Vite configuration optimized for production
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing and deployment automation
- ✅ **Accessibility Testing**: Automated axe-core accessibility checks

## Deployment Workflow
1. Code pushed to main branch triggers GitHub Actions
2. Dependencies installed and project built with Vite
3. Build artifacts deployed to GitHub Pages
4. Custom domain serves the application at https://limpopoconnect.site

## Performance Optimizations
- Source maps disabled for production
- Code splitting with manual chunks for major dependencies
- Minified build with esbuild
- Service worker for offline functionality
- PWA manifest for native app-like experience
