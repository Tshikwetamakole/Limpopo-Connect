-- supabase/seed.sql
-- Purpose: seed minimal data for local dev

-- Create a demo room owned by the first auth user if exists (noop if none)
-- Note: auth users are managed by GoTrue; insert will fail if no users exist.
-- This file is optional and safe to run repeatedly.

-- No-op placeholder; seeds can be added via studio when users exist.
