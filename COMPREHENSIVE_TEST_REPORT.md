1. **User Flows**:
   - Complete registration → onboarding → dashboard journey
   - Login → profile edit → avatar upload → save
   - Business directory browsing → business detail view
   - Event browsing → event registration (if implemented)

2. **UI/UX Validation**:
   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Form validation and error messages
   - Loading states
   - Navigation flow

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Chrome
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

4. **Security Scenarios**:
   - Unauthorized route access attempts
   - Token expiration handling
   - XSS attempt in input fields
   - Role-based feature access

**Reference**: See `COMPREHENSIVE_MANUAL_TEST_GUIDE.md` for 51 detailed manual test cases.
