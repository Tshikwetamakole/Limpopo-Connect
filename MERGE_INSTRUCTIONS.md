## Troubleshooting Post-Merge Issues

### Build Fails in GitHub Actions

**Check**:
1. Review Actions logs for specific error
2. Verify environment variables are set in Secrets
3. Check Node.js version matches (18.x)

**Fix**:
```bash
# If environment variables missing, add in GitHub:
# Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret
```

### Vercel Build Fails

**Check**:
1. Review Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Check build command is `npm run build`

**Fix**:
1. Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add missing variables
3. Redeploy

### Application Not Loading

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Check if Supabase project is active

**Fix**:
1. Verify environment variables are correct
2. Check Supabase project status
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Database Connection Fails

**Check**:
1. Supabase project status (not paused)
2. RLS policies are applied
3. Environment variables are correct

**Fix**:
1. Run migrations: `supabase db push`
2. Verify RLS policies exist
3. Check API keys have no extra spaces
