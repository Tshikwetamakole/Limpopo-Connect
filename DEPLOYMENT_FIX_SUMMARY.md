# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Package Lock File Out of Sync ✅
**Issue**: The `package-lock.json` was out of sync with `package.json`, causing `npm ci` to fail in GitHub Actions.

**Fix**: Ran `npm install` to update the lock file with the latest Supabase dependencies.

**Impact**: This was preventing the GitHub Actions workflow from building the project.

---

### 2. Incorrect Base Path in Vite Configuration ✅
**Issue**: The `vite.config.ts` was configured to use `/Limpopo-Connect/` as the base path when `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable was set. This is correct for GitHub Pages hosted at `username.github.io/repo-name/`, but incorrect for custom domain deployments.

**Before**:
```typescript
base: process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY
  ? `/${process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY.split('/')[1]}/`
  : (process.env.BASE_PATH || '/'),
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Base path for deployment
// Since we're using a custom domain (limpopoconnect.site), the base path should be '/'
base: '/',
```

**Impact**: All asset paths in the built HTML were incorrect (e.g., `/Limpopo-Connect/assets/...` instead of `/assets/...`), which would cause the site to fail to load on the custom domain.

---

### 3. Missing CNAME File ✅
**Issue**: No CNAME file existed in the `public/` folder to specify the custom domain.

**Fix**: Created `public/CNAME` with content:
```
limpopoconnect.site
```

**Impact**: The CNAME file is automatically copied to the `dist/` folder during build and tells GitHub Pages to serve the site on the custom domain.

---

### 4. Conflicting Deployment Workflows ✅
**Issue**: Two GitHub Actions workflows were configured to deploy to GitHub Pages on every push to main:
- `deploy-pages.yml` (official GitHub Pages deployment)
- `deploy-gh-pages.yml` (using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)

**Fix**: Disabled `deploy-gh-pages.yml` by commenting out its trigger to avoid conflicts.

**Impact**: Prevents duplicate deployments and potential conflicts.

## Verification

### Build Output
```bash
$ npm run build
✓ built in 4.46s
```

### Generated Files
- ✅ `dist/CNAME` - Contains `limpopoconnect.site`
- ✅ `dist/index.html` - All paths use `/` base (not `/Limpopo-Connect/`)
- ✅ All assets in `dist/assets/` folder

### Test Results
Frontend and business logic tests pass. Two backend test files fail due to pre-existing issues with missing dependencies in the vitest configuration (not related to deployment).

---

## Deployment Workflow

The active deployment workflow is `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`:

1. Triggers on push to `main` branch
2. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Builds project with `npm run build`
4. Uploads `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
5. Deploys to custom domain `limpopoconnect.site`

---

## Next Steps

When this PR is merged to main:
1. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy
2. The site will be accessible at `https://limpopoconnect.site`
3. All assets will load correctly with proper paths

## Files Changed

1. `package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies
2. `vite.config.ts` - Fixed base path for custom domain
3. `public/CNAME` - Added custom domain configuration
4. `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` - Disabled to prevent conflicts
