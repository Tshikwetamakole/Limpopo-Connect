## 🛠 Development Environment

### Local Setup
```bash
# Supabase local development stack
supabase start

# Services running on:
API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
Database URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
```

### React Development
```bash
# Frontend development server
npm run dev

# Available at: http://localhost:5173/Limpopo-Connect/
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### RLS Policies
- **Profiles**: Users can only see their own profile
- **Rooms**: Only room creators can manage rooms (simplified for demo)
- **Room Members**: Users can see their own memberships
- **Messages**: Users can only see their own messages (simplified for demo)
- **Audit**: Message authors can see audit records for their messages

### Authentication
- Secure session management with Supabase Auth
- JWT token-based authentication
- Protected API endpoints with user context
- Automatic profile creation on user registration

## 📁 Key Files

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20251010_init_core_schema.sql` - Complete schema (594 lines)
- `supabase/functions/post-message/index.ts` - Message posting Edge Function
- `supabase/functions/summary-worker/index.ts` - AI summarization worker

### React Components
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/lib/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook
- `src/lib/useRooms.ts` - Room management hooks
- `src/lib/realtime.ts` - Realtime subscription management
- `src/lib/AuthProvider.tsx` - React authentication context
- `src/pages/ChatDemo.tsx` - Complete demo interface (200+ lines)

### Testing
- `scripts/test-integration.mjs` - Comprehensive integration test (393 lines)
- `scripts/test-direct.mjs` - Direct database operation test
- `scripts/validate-supabase.mjs` - Environment validation

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Database Trigger Issues ✅
**Problem**: "record 'new' has no field 'updated_at'" error in triggers
**Solution**: Added missing `updated_at` column to `message_threads` table and fixed audit triggers to use explicit `jsonb_build_object` instead of `to_jsonb()`

### RLS Policy Recursion ✅
**Problem**: Infinite recursion in room_members policies
**Solution**: Simplified RLS policies to avoid circular references while maintaining security

### Authentication Integration ✅
**Problem**: Complex state management for authentication
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive React context with proper session handling
